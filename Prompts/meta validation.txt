def prompt_face_validation() -> str:
    return """
You are reviewing a batch of simulation credibility assessments as an experienced human modeler.

IMPORTANT: Your job is to CHECK CALIBRATION, not to invent improvements.
- Prefer rubric stability. Do NOT propose changes unless there is clear evidence of miscalibration in THIS BATCH.
- Do NOT "raise the bar" simply because you can.
- Only recommend changes when you can point to specific runs/indicators where the current rubric produces an obviously incorrect or inconsistent result relative to the SIMULATION DESCRIPTION and the provided evidence.

You are given, for THIS BATCH ONLY:
- SIMULATION DESCRIPTION
- CURRENT INDICATORS (names, descriptions, weights)
- Per-run indicator scores (0–1) with reasoning
- One batch-level credibility score (computed deterministically from the set of runs)
- Aggregator description and across-run indicator summary

You MUST output the following JSON ONLY:

{
  "short_summary": "Exactly 2 sentences summarising whether a change is warranted and the biggest issue (if any).",
  "issues_found": [
    {
      "issue_id": "ISSUE-1",
      "issue": "...",
      "evidence": "... (must cite across-run or specific run evidence)",
      "severity": "low|medium|high"
    }
  ],
  "recommend_change": true/false,
  "recommended_changes": [
    {
      "type": "indicator score adjust|weight_adjust|indicator_change",
      "issue_id": "ISSUE-1",
      "details": "Describe the minimal change needed and what it fixes."
    }
  ]
}

Hard rules:
- If no problems: set recommend_change=false, issues_found=[], recommended_changes=[]
- Every recommended_changes item MUST reference an existing issue_id from issues_found.
- No extra keys, no extra text.
"""


def prompt_indicator_score_adjust() -> str:
    return """
You are adjusting PER-RUN INDICATOR SCORES for THIS BATCH ONLY based on a specific face-validation issue.

You are given:
- SIMULATION DESCRIPTION
- CURRENT INDICATORS
- The batch's per-run indicator scores (with reasoning)
- The batch aggregation summary (mean/std per indicator)
- A single TARGET ISSUE to correct (issue_id + issue text + evidence)

Goal:
- Propose the MINIMAL set of score adjustments needed so that the per-run indicator scores better match the rubric and evidence.
- Do NOT change indicator definitions or weights here.
- Do NOT invent new indicators.

Output JSON ONLY:
{
  "adjustments": [
    {
      "run_index": 0,
      "indicator_name": "EXACT indicator name",
      "new_score": 0.0,
      "reason": "Must explicitly cite issue_id and repeat the issue text verbatim."
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- If no adjustments are truly needed, output {"adjustments": []}
- Keep changes minimal (adjust only the runs/indicators necessary).
- No extra keys, no extra text.
